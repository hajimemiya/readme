# Physical Computing
### Definition

>Physical computing involves interactive systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware.
>
>Physical Computing intersects the range of activities often referred to in academia and industry as electrical engineering, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, and especially embedded development.

### Physical Computing Examples & Reflections

**[Liǎn (脸), Jann Choy](https://jannchoy.com/lian.html)**

>Liǎn (脸) is an experimental mask that explores the relationship between our online personas and offline self. It responds to one's real time online emotions.
>
>Liǎn is heavily inspired by the Chinese face changing opera art 变脸 (biàn liǎn) and online avatars. 变脸 translates to face changing. The performer changes their face to signify a shift in emotion. This performance parallels our online behaviours; we wear many faces online and are able to change them at any moment.
