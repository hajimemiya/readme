# Physical Computing As a Trigger for Human Interaction
### Definition

>Physical computing involves interactive systems that can sense and respond to the world around them. While this definition is broad enough to encompass systems such as smart automotive traffic control systems or factory automation processes, it is not commonly used to describe them. In a broader sense, physical computing is a creative framework for understanding human beings' relationship to the digital world. In practical use, the term most often describes handmade art, design or DIY hobby projects that use sensors and microcontrollers to translate analog input to a software system, and/or control electro-mechanical devices such as motors, servos, lighting or other hardware.
>
>Physical Computing intersects the range of activities often referred to in academia and industry as electrical engineering, mechatronics, robotics, computer science, and especially embedded development.

### Physical Computing Examples & Reflections

**[Liǎn (脸), Jann Choy](https://jannchoy.com/lian.html)**

>Liǎn (脸) is an experimental mask that explores the relationship between our online personas and offline self. It responds to one's real time online emotions.
>
>Liǎn is heavily inspired by the Chinese face changing opera art 变脸 (biàn liǎn) and online avatars. 变脸 translates to face changing. The performer changes their face to signify a shift in emotion. This performance parallels our online behaviours; we wear many faces online and are able to change them at any moment.

>...mechanical mirrors are made of various materials but share the same behavior and interaction; any person standing in front of one of these pieces is instantly reflected on its surface. The mechanical mirrors all have video cameras, motors and computers on board and produce a soothing sound as the viewer interacts with them.

>This installation work consists 3 artworks, a painting (abstract drawing on canvas), a sculpture (replicated buddha) and a video (on the display). However, each artwork that combined with ready made product which has movement as function attempt to avoid to be appreciated from spectator (human). If you close to the artwork, painting lies down on the floor, sculpture turns away and goes far off, video slides away along the wall. Each artwork speaks about the reason why the Art should be escape from being seen/understood by human. Furthermore, there are several displays in the space and those are intently showing process of searching the meanings on Google by using voice from the artworks as input. Those are worked as metaphor for humans behavior in the museum or gallery that searching the meanings meaninglessly. Their insistence based on eastern philosophy from before the century especially Zhuangzi's thoughts who has criticized intelligence that human believed in that era. Zhuangzi has explained so many facts around our life by his own logic and witty allegory and those are still suggestive even for modern people. Now, the art, technology, society, every system, every rules organizing this world are born and grew up in western society and dominant our life. Thus, artworks preaches the necessity to relativate our society established with western philosophy by irradiate eastern thoughts accompany by movement which escape from human. Through this artwork, posing the problems about mechanism/politics of seeing the Art, or modern humans physicality which is dominated by languages.

### Issues We face

One of the issue currently discussed is related to smartphone. Although smartphone allows us to enjoy customised experiences, it accelerates excluding each others from the personal space. A sociologist Shinji Miyadai explains when he saw the intersection in Shibuya, Tokyo, which is the largest in the country, he felt anyones there were living in the same world although they physically share spaces...
